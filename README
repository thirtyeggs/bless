Change History
--------------------------------------------------
V0.11: 10/24/2013
First release.

V0.12: 12/02/2013
Single-end (or merged paired-end) reads are supported.
A bug in correcting errors in the first k-mer is corrected.

V0.13: 04/06/2014
Error correction accuracy has been improved especially for highly repetitive genomes.
BLESS supports dumping/loading the Bloom filter contents.
Reads are trimmed by default.

V0.14: 04/08/2014
Everything is equal to V0.13 except that this version supports Illumina 1.8+ FASTQ files.

V0.15: 05/16/2014
A bug that may occurs when overall quality scores are very bad is fixed.
Reads that have more than MAX_N_RATIO * <read length> Ns are modified (default MAX_N_RATIO: 0.1).

V0.16: 05/24/2014
Memory leak that may happen in a read with many low-quality-score bases is fixed.

V0.17: 06/03/2014
A bug in setting the maximum allowed Ns for paired reads is fixed.

V0.20: 10/16/2014
BLESS is parallelized using OpenMP and MPI.
Reads with different length are supported.
The k-mer counting part is substituted with KMC (http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/kmc).
Even values can be used for k.
Some minor bugs are fixed.

V0.21: 12/06/2014
White space characters in correted read files are removed.
The multi-threaded runtime is improved.

V0.22: 12/17/2014
MPI is applied to KMC.

V0.23: 12/19/2014
Minor bugs are fixed.

V0.24: 01/29/2015
KMC is updated to 2.2.1 (The max memory usage of KMC can be fixed to 4 GB for any genome).
A bug in writing a quality score hisgoram file is fixed.

V0.25: XX/XX/2015
Gzipped input reads can be used.
Corrected reads can be compressed (-gzip).
All the dependent libraries are included.
Non-ACGTN characters are converted to Ns.
Bugs are fixed.


--------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
--------------------------------------------------
Compiling BLESS requires MPI libraries. The latest version was tested with GCC 4.9.2, MPICH 3.1.3
(or OpenMPI 1.8.2).
If you see the following error message, you need to upgrade your MPI library:
error: initializing argument 2 of 'int MPI_File_open(MPI_Comm, char*, int, MPI_Info, ompi_file_t)'**


--------------------------------------------------
How to Install BLESS
--------------------------------------------------
Specify your Boost include and library directories in Makefile
using BOOST_INC and BOOST_LIB variables.
Then type make.


--------------------------------------------------
How to Run BLESS
--------------------------------------------------
Single-end reads or merged paired-end reads
> ./bless -read <fastq> -prefix <output prefix> -kmerlength <k-mer length>
<fastq>        : fastq file name
<output prefix>: <output directory name>/<file prefix>
<k-mer length> : k-mer length (odd number)

Paired-end reads
> ./bless -read1 <forward fastq> -read2 <reverse fastq> -prefix <output prefix> -kmerlength <k-mer length>
<forward fastq>: first read file of a paired-end fastq file
<reverse fastq>: second read file of a paired-end fastq file
<output prefix>: <output directory name>/<file prefix>
<k-mer length> : k-mer length (odd number)

Run bless with no option to see the entire options.


--------------------------------------------------
Parallelizing BLESS
--------------------------------------------------
BLESS is parallelized using OpenMP and MPI.  The number of threads per each node can be changed
using "-smpthread" option (default: the number of cores in a SMP node).

Using multiple nodes using MPI
Launch single process on a node and bind the processes to their nodes
Ex) MPICH 3.1.3 Hydra Version
> mpirun -ppn 1 -bind-to board ./bless -read1 <forward fastq> -read2 <reverse fastq> -prefix <output prefix> -kmerlength <k-mer length>


--------------------------------------------------
Choosing k-mer length
--------------------------------------------------
Our empirical analysis shows that the k value that satisfies the following two conditions usually generates the results close to the best one:
1) Ns / 4^k ≤ 0.0001 where Ns represents the number of unique solid k-mers (BLESS reports Ns).
2) Number of corrected bases becomes the maximum at the chosen k value, which means you need to increase k as long as the number of corrected reads increases.


--------------------------------------------------
How to Load Existing Bloom Filter Data
--------------------------------------------------
If you run BLESS with the "-prefix prefix" option, BLESS automatically generates the files prefix.bf.data and prefix.bf.size that have the contents of the Bloom filter.
These files can be loaded into BLESS to skip the time-consuming Bloom filter build process.

Single-end reads or merged paired-end reads
> ./bless -read <fastq> -load prefix -prefix <new prefix> -kmerlength <k-mer length>

Paired-end reads
> ./bless -read1 <forward fastq> -read2 <reverse fastq> -load prefix -prefix <new prefix> -kmerlength <k-mer length>
